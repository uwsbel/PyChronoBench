        "instruction": "What is the purpose of 'vis.AddLightWithShadow()' in the visualization setup? 'A. To add a camera', 'B. To create a light source with shadows', 'C. To initialize the simulation', 'D. To set the window title'",
        "output": "The correct answer is **B. To create a light source with shadows**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **PyChrono** is a Python library for physics simulations. Its visualization module (`vis`) allows you to see the simulation in action.\n\n* **`vis.AddLightWithShadow()`** is a specific function within this visualization module. Its name clearly indicates its purpose: to add a light source to the scene that will cast shadows on objects.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\n* **A. To add a camera:**  While PyChrono does have camera control, `AddLightWithShadow()` is not the function for that.\n\n* **C. To initialize the simulation:**  Simulation initialization is handled by other PyChrono functions, not directly by `AddLightWithShadow()`.\n\n* **D. To set the window title:**  Window title settings are typically done using standard GUI functions, not PyChrono visualization functions."
